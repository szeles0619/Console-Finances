# Console-Finances

## Description

To be honest with this assignment I struggled a lot, I had to use different resources from the web and  from classmates.
In this project I learned how to use for loop to calculate the following :

    - Total number of months, 
    - Net total,
    - Average change,
    - Greatest increase, 
    - Greatest decrease.

In this task I had to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.
